sms-xml
=======

Simple XML template to easy the conversion and integration of sms messages with other protocols, and a proposal of a standard.

This is useful for example to convert sms text messages to rss feeds and integrate various message protocols and services.

People have been telling me that this kind of thing already exists. The rule to me is simple: if you don't have the code hosted somewhere, documented and easy to find, it doesn't exists.

I don't care if you have your bundled software with all kind of fancy features used by millions of people daily. If someone can't simply borrow a part of your software to do a complete different thing that you never ever imagined, then your software is useless to everyone but you.
